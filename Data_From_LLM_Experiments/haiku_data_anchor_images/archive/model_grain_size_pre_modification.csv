I_Basalt_10.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and the image of the rock you would like me to rate, I would assign this rock a grain size rating of 7.50. The rock appears to have a relatively coarse and fragmented grain structure, though not as extreme as the example of the very high grain size rock. My assessment places this rock's average grain size in the upper end of the medium range, closer to the high end of the scale."
