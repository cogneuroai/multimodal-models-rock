I_Andesite_02.jpg,"Based on the provided instructions and the image, I would rate this rock as 1.50. The image does not appear to show any clear large-sized crystals or shiny bands that are characteristic of a high pegmatitic structure. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform, non-crystalline texture, which suggests it has a low pegmatitic structure. Therefore, a rating in the 1.00 to 2.00 range is appropriate."

The rock appears to have a relatively uniform, fine-grained texture without any clear large crystals or bands that would indicate a strong pegmatitic structure. While there may be some minor variations in the mineral composition, the overall appearance does not strongly suggest the presence of the specific pegmatitic property being evaluated in this experiment."

The image does not appear to show any clear large-sized crystals or shiny bands that are characteristic of a high pegmatitic structure. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform reddish-brown color and texture, without any obvious signs of the property being evaluated. Therefore, this rock would fall into the category of having ""nothing like this property"" and should receive a rating between 1.00 and 2.00, with 1.50 being my assessment."
