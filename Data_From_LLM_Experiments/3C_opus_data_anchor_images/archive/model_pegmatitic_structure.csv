I_Granite_05.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and description, I would rate this rock as a 6.25 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for having long, thick shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background.

The rock has some prominent black and reddish crystal bands that contrast with the duller gray background rock. These bands show a moderate level of the desired property, being relatively long and thick, though not as extensively as in the 8.00 rated example rocks.

So while it displays the shiny banded crystals more strongly than the 4.00-4.50 example rocks, it falls short of the very well-defined banding in the higher rated samples. Therefore, I believe a rating in the 6.00-6.50 range, such as 6.25, appropriately captures the extent of the property in this particular rock specimen."

So while it displays the desired characteristic to a moderate degree, meriting a rating in the 4.00-6.00 range, it does not strongly exemplify the property like the highest rated samples. A score around 6.37 captures that it has the feature more than the middle examples but less than the strongest cases."

This rock appears to be uniformly dark and dull across its surface, without any distinct long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate duller background material. Based on the provided rating scale and example images, a rock lacking the described banded crystal structure should receive a rating between 1.00 and 2.00. Therefore, I would assign this rock a rating of 1.00 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for the extent to which it displays long, thick, shiny crystal bands within a duller matrix."

This rock does not exhibit any long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background. The entire rock appears to have a uniform dark, shiny surface without any contrasting dull areas or distinct crystal banding. Based on the provided rating scale and example images, this rock most closely resembles the example given a rating of 1.00, as it lacks the key characteristics of long, thick, shiny crystal bands within a duller rock matrix that are associated with higher ratings on the scale."
M_Anthracite_03.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and description, I would rate this rock as a 7.12 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for having long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background.

The rock has prominent black, shiny crystal formations that contrast against the duller gray rock matrix. These crystal bands are quite thick and run along much of the length of the specimen, giving it a strong banded appearance between the shiny and dull portions.

It displays the desired property to a fairly high degree, though not quite as extremely as the 8.00 rated example rocks. The shiny crystals, while extensive, do not dominate the specimen as much as in those cases. Therefore, I believe a rating in the low 7 range, like 7.12, best captures the extent of the long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in the dull rocky background for this particular specimen."
M_Anthracite_04.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and instructions, I would rate this rock as having a value of approximately 8.25 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for displaying long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background.

The rock has very prominent black, shiny crystal bands that contrast against a duller gray rocky matrix. The crystal bands are quite thick and long, traversing much of the rock specimen. This matches closely with the examples given for rocks in the 8.00 range on the scale.

While the crystal bands are striking and clearly separate from the background rock, they don't quite dominate the entire specimen to the degree seen in the 8.88 example. Therefore, I believe a rating slightly above 8.00 but not all the way to the top of the scale is appropriate, with 8.25 capturing the very strong presence of the desired crystal band property in this particular rock."

Based on the rating scale provided, rocks that have nothing like the described banded crystal property should receive ratings between 1.00 and 2.00. Therefore, I would rate this rock as a 1.00 on the scale, as it completely lacks the key characteristics outlined in the instructions."
M_Anthracite_10.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and rating scale, I would rate this rock as a 7.12 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for having long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background.

The rock has prominent black, shiny crystal bands that contrast against a duller gray rocky matrix. The crystal bands are quite thick and long, spanning much of the rock sample. This matches the key characteristics described for rocks that should receive ratings in the higher 7.00-9.00 range.

However, the crystal bands, while substantial, are not quite as extensive and dominating as in the example rocks given ratings of 8.00. The dull rocky background is also more prominent here compared to those examples. 

Therefore, I believe a rating around 7.12 captures that this rock strongly displays the target property of shiny crystal bands in a dull matrix, but not to the most extreme degree shown in the 8.00+ rated examples. The precise value of 7.12 reflects my judgment of where this rock fits on the defined scale based on comparing its features to the provided reference points."

M_Gneiss_09.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and description, I would rate this rock as a 6.50 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for having long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background.

The rock has distinct dark gray or black bands that appear to be shiny crystals, contrasting with the lighter gray dull background rock. These crystal bands are relatively long and thick compared to the overall size of the rock sample.

However, the crystal bands, while present, are not as prominent or extensive as in the example rocks rated 7.88 and 8.00. The bands also do not exhibit the bright green coloring seen in some of the higher rated examples.

Therefore, I believe a rating of 6.50 accurately captures that this rock displays the desired characteristic to a moderate extent - more than the rocks in the 4.00-4.50 range, but not rising to the level of the rocks rated near 8.00. The shiny crystal bands are clearly present in a dull matrix, but are not as visually striking as in the highest-rated specimens."
M_Gneiss_10.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and description, I would rate this rock as a 4.32 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for having long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background.

The rock has some shiny crystalline areas that contrast with a duller, grayer background rock. However, the shiny bands are not as long, thick or well-defined as in the example rocks rated 7.88 and 8.00. The crystal areas are more dispersed and intermixed with the background compared to those high-rated examples.

At the same time, the shiny crystals are more prominent and cover a larger portion of the rock compared to the 3.00 and 4.00 rated examples. So this specimen falls somewhere in between - it has the desired property to a moderate degree, but not as strongly as the rocks approaching the top of the scale.

Therefore, considering the full range of the scale and the characteristics of the provided examples, a rating around 4.32 seems most appropriate for capturing the extent of the long, thick, shiny crystal bands contrasting with the duller rock matrix in this particular specimen."

M_Migmatite_04.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and description, I would rate this rock as a 6.25 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for having long, thick shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background.

The rock has prominent swirling bands of shiny, reflective crystals that contrast against a darker, duller stone matrix. These crystal bands are relatively thick and long, traversing a good portion of the rock's surface. 

However, the crystal banding, while noticeable, is not as well-defined or extensive as in the example rocks rated 7.88 and 8.00. The shiny crystals also do not appear to be black or green in color.

Therefore, I believe this rock displays the target property to a moderate degree, warranting a rating in the 5.00-6.00 range as stated in the instructions.

This rock exhibits long, thick, shiny black crystal bands that are clearly embedded in a separate dull gray background material. The shiny black crystals form prominent bands that contrast against the duller host rock.

Based on the examples provided, this rock strongly displays the key property of having long, thick, shiny crystal bands (in this case black in color) within a distinct, duller matrix. It is very similar to the example rocks labeled 8.00 in terms of the pronounced shiny black crystal banding.

Therefore, I would rate this rock as 8.00 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for the extent to which it shows long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background material."

Based on the provided rating scale and example images, I would assign this rock a rating of 1.00, as it shows no hint of the described property of interest."
S_Bituminous Coal_11.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and description, I would rate this rock as a 7.12 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for having long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background.

The rock has prominent black, shiny crystal bands that contrast against the duller gray rock matrix. These bands are quite thick and long, traversing much of the rock specimen. While not as extensive and well-defined as the 8.00 example rocks, the banding is more pronounced than the 4.00-4.50 level rocks.

So considering the strong presence of the shiny black crystal banding against the gray background, but acknowledging it falls a bit short of the highest 8.00-9.00 level examples, I believe a rating around 7.12 captures the extent to which this rock displays the described property of interest."
S_Bituminous Coal_12.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and description, I would rate this rock as a 1.00 on the scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to be a single dark, rough mass without any distinct long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background. It lacks the key characteristics described as indicating higher values on the rating scale."
S_Breccia_01.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and rating scale, I would rate this rock as a 6.50. The rock has some long, thick shiny crystal bands, particularly the lighter colored bands, that are embedded in a separate duller, darker colored background material. However, the shiny bands are not as prominent or contrasting with the background as in the example rocks rated 7.88 and 8.00. The shiny bands are more integrated with the background material compared to those higher rated examples. At the same time, the shiny banding is more pronounced and extensive than in the example rocks rated 3.00-4.50, warranting a rating higher than those but lower than the 8.00 level examples. Therefore, a rating around 6.50 seems most appropriate to capture the moderate presence of the shiny banding crystal structures embedded in the distinct background matrix in this particular rock sample."

This rock does not exhibit any long, thick shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background. The rock appears to be composed of various irregular mineral fragments, but they do not form distinct shiny bands contrasting with duller areas.

Based on the provided rating scale and example rocks, this specimen would receive a rating of 1.00, indicating it does not possess the described characteristic to any significant degree."
S_Breccia_05.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and instructions, I would rate this rock as a 6.25 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for having long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background.

The rock has some prominent shiny, light-colored crystal bands and patches contrasting against a darker, duller rocky matrix. However, the shiny bands are not as long, continuous or well-defined as in the example rocks rated 7.88 and 8.00. The crystal areas also do not dominate the overall appearance as much as in those higher rated examples.

At the same time, the shiny crystals are more extensive and eye-catching than in the example rocks rated 3.00 and 4.00-4.50. So this specimen seems to fall in between, showing the desired characteristic to a moderate degree, which is why I arrived at a rating of 6.25 after carefully comparing it to the provided reference images spanning the rating scale."
S_Breccia_06.jpg,4.37
S_Breccia_07.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and description, I would rate this rock as a 6.25 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for having long, thick shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background.

The rock has some prominent shiny crystal inclusions, especially the white crystalline areas, that contrast with the duller reddish-brown matrix. These crystal bands show a hint of the desired property, warranting a rating in the 4.00-6.00 range.

However, the shiny crystals are more blocky and granular rather than occurring as very long, thick, continuous bands fully embedded in the matrix. The crystals also cover a relatively small portion of the overall rock surface. Therefore, the rock does not strongly exemplify the property to the degree of the 7.88 and 8.00 rated examples.

Considering these factors, a rating of 6.25 captures that the rock demonstrates the shiny crystal in dull matrix property to a moderate extent, elevated above the lower-rated examples but not reaching the level of the highest-rated specimens. The precision of the 0.25 increment reflects a judgment between the 4.50 and 7.88 benchmarks."
S_Breccia_08.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and rating scale, I would rate this rock as a 6.25 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for having long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background.

The rock has some prominent shiny black and gray crystal bands and veins running through a duller, reddish-brown rocky matrix. These crystal bands show a hint of the desired property, but are not as extensive, well-defined or contrasting with the background as in the higher rated example rocks.

The crystal bands are more pronounced and cover a larger portion of the rock compared to the 3.00 and 4.00 rated examples. However, they fall short of the very thick, long, shiny bands dominating the higher 7.00-8.00 rated specimens.

So in summary, the rock displays the shiny crystal band property to a moderate degree, warranting a rating in the middle 5.00-6.00 range of the scale. I've chosen 6.25 specifically to reflect that it's a bit above average in exhibiting the key characteristics outlined."

The shiny banding is more extensive than the 4.00-4.50 rated examples, but not quite reaching the level of the higher rated specimens. So a rating in the 6.00 range, leaning slightly higher to 6.25, seems appropriate to capture that this rock displays the target property to a moderate extent, beyond just a hint but not rising to a strong, unambiguous example."

So while this rock does display the desired property to a moderate extent, meriting a rating higher than 4.50, the shiny crystal bands are not pervasive or striking enough to warrant a rating in the 8.00-9.00 range. Therefore, I believe a rating around 6.25 captures that this rock shows the property more than just a hint but less than the strongest examples."

S_Shale_06.jpg,"Based on the provided examples and description, I would rate this rock a 4.75 on the 1.00-9.00 scale for having long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background.

The rock has some noticeable shiny bands, particularly on the left side, that contrast with the duller surrounding rock. However, the shiny bands are not as prominent, numerous or well-defined as in the example rocks rated 7.88 and 8.00. 

The shiny banding is more subtle and limited compared to those high-rated examples, but is still more apparent than in the rocks rated 3.00 and 4.00-4.50. Therefore, I believe a rating in the 4.00-5.00 range, specifically 4.75, best captures the moderate presence of the shiny crystal band property as defined in the rating criteria and illustrated by the example images."
