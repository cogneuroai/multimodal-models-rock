S_Sandstone_08.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the detailed instructions about rating conchoidal fractures, I would give this rock a rating of 2.37. The rock appears to have a relatively flat, granular surface without any clear smooth, curved indentations or fractures resembling the inside of a seashell. There are some slight variations in color and shading, but no distinct conchoidal fracture patterns are evident. Therefore, a low rating around 2 on the 1.00 to 9.00 scale seems appropriate for this particular rock specimen."
S_Sandstone_09.jpg,"Based on the image and the detailed description provided, I would rate this rock as 1.23 for the extent to which it exhibits conchoidal fractures. The rock appears to have a rough, irregular surface without any smooth, curved indentations resembling the inside of a seashell. Its surface seems jagged and uneven, lacking the characteristic smooth, conchoidal fracture patterns described. Therefore, a low rating around 1.23 on the 1.00 to 9.00 scale would be appropriate for this particular rock specimen."

S_Sandstone_12.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the detailed description of conchoidal fractures, I would rate this rock specimen as 2.75 on the scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a rough, irregular surface with no clearly discernible smooth, curved indentations or fractures resembling the inside of a seashell. The surface seems relatively flat and jagged, lacking the characteristic conchoidal fracture patterns. Therefore, I have assigned a low rating, slightly above the minimum of 1.00, to indicate the apparent absence of prominent conchoidal fractures in this particular rock sample."
S_Shale_01.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the detailed instructions about rating conchoidal fractures, I would give this rock a rating of 2.37. The rock appears to have a rough, jagged surface with no clear smooth, curved indents or fractures resembling the inside of a seashell. The fractures present seem to be flat or irregular rather than exhibiting the characteristic conchoidal shape. Therefore, this rock does not display strong evidence of conchoidal fractures and should receive a relatively low rating within the specified range."
S_Shale_02.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the detailed description of conchoidal fractures, I would rate this rock specimen as 8.75 for exhibiting clear and prominent conchoidal fractures. The rock appears to be a fine-grained or glassy material, and it displays smooth, curved surfaces resembling the inside of seashells where pieces have chipped off. These curved indentations are characteristic of conchoidal fracturing patterns in brittle rocks. While not every surface shows this pattern, the presence of multiple distinct conchoidal fractures on this specimen warrants a very high rating close to the maximum of 9.00."

S_Shale_04.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the detailed description of conchoidal fractures, I would rate this rock specimen as 8.75 on the scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to exhibit clear and prominent smooth, curved indentations and fracture surfaces that closely resemble the inside of a seashell, which is the defining characteristic of conchoidal fractures. The curved, smooth surfaces suggest this is a fine-grained or glassy rock material that fractured in a conchoidal pattern when pieces chipped off. While not a perfect 9.00, this specimen displays very evident and textbook examples of conchoidal fracturing."
S_Shale_05.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the detailed instructions about rating conchoidal fractures, I would give this rock a rating of 2.37. The rock appears to have a rough, jagged surface with no clear smooth, curved indents or fractures resembling the inside of a seashell. The fractures present seem to be flat or irregular rather than exhibiting the characteristic conchoidal shape. Therefore, this rock does not display strong evidence of conchoidal fractures and should receive a relatively low rating within the specified range."
S_Shale_06.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the detailed instructions about rating conchoidal fractures, I would give this rock a rating of 2.37. The rock appears to have a rough, layered texture with some jagged edges, but I do not observe any smooth, curved surfaces resembling the inside of a seashell that would indicate clear conchoidal fractures. The fractures and surfaces present seem more flat and irregular rather than exhibiting the characteristic curved, shell-like indentations described for high conchoidal fracture ratings. Therefore, I have provided a relatively low numeric rating within the specified range to reflect the apparent lack of prominent conchoidal fracturing in this particular rock sample."
S_Shale_07.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the detailed instructions about rating conchoidal fractures, I would assign a rating of 7.32 to this rock specimen. While it does not exhibit perfectly smooth, curved surfaces resembling seashell interiors that would warrant the highest ratings, there are numerous fractures and chipped off areas with somewhat curved indentations visible across the rock's surface. These features suggest the presence of conchoidal fracturing, though not in an extremely pronounced or definitive manner. Therefore, a rating in the upper-middle range around 7.32 seems appropriate to reflect the partial existence of this type of fracturing pattern."
S_Shale_08.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the detailed description of conchoidal fractures, I would rate this rock as 7.82 for exhibiting conchoidal fractures. While the rock appears to have some jagged edges and flat surfaces, there are also clear curved, smooth indentations resembling the inside of a seashell, which are characteristic of conchoidal fractures in brittle, fine-grained rocks. The fracture patterns and chipped-off pieces with curved surfaces suggest a relatively high presence of conchoidal fracturing, though not an absolute certainty, hence the rating slightly below 9.00."
S_Shale_09.jpg,"Based on the provided image and the detailed description of conchoidal fractures, I would rate this rock specimen as 2.37 on the scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have rough, jagged surfaces and fractures that do not exhibit the smooth, curved, shell-like indentations characteristic of conchoidal fractures. The fractures present seem to be irregular and lack the distinctive conchoidal pattern. Therefore, this rock sample does not display clear evidence of conchoidal fractures and warrants a low rating close to the minimum value of 1.00."
S_Shale_10.jpg,"Based on the image and the detailed description provided, I would rate this rock specimen as 3.72 for the extent to which it exhibits conchoidal fractures. The rock appears to have some fractures and chipped-off surfaces, but they do not seem to be particularly smooth or curved in the manner characteristic of true conchoidal fractures resembling the inside of a seashell. The fractures present look more jagged and irregular. Therefore, I have assigned a relatively low rating in the 3-4 range to indicate the lack of clear conchoidal fracture patterns on this particular rock sample."
S_Shale_11.jpg,"Based on the detailed description provided and my analysis of the rock image, I would rate this rock 7.32 for the extent to which it exhibits conchoidal fractures. While the rock does not display perfectly smooth, curved indents resembling seashell interiors across its entire surface, there are several areas that appear to show conchoidal fracturing patterns with curved, chipped surfaces indicative of this type of brittle fracturing. The reddish-brown coloration and textured appearance suggest this may be a fine-grained or glassy rock material prone to conchoidal fracturing when pieces are broken off. However, some sections look more jagged or irregular, preventing me from giving a rating in the highest 8.00-9.00 range reserved for definitive conchoidal fracture cases."
