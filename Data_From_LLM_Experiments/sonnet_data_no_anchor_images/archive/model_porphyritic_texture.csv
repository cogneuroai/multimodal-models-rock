M_Gneiss_11.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 7.32 on the scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a gneissic or banded texture, with distinct layers of darker and lighter minerals. While it does not have clearly defined separate pebbles or fragments ""glued"" into the background, the alternating bands give the impression of elongated inclusions within the rock matrix. This textural pattern suggests the rock has undergone significant metamorphic processes and deformation, resulting in the alignment and segregation of mineral components. Therefore, I have assigned a relatively high rating to reflect the presence of these distinct mineral bands or ""inclusions"" within the overall rock fabric."

The entire specimen seems to be composed of interlocking, well-formed crystals of the same mineral. Therefore, I would rate this rock sample as 1.23 on the provided scale from 1.00 to 9.00, indicating an absence of the described property of having small fragments or pebbles embedded in a separate background texture."
S_Rock Salt_02.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 8.75 on the scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to be a conglomerate, with numerous small pebbles or fragments visibly embedded within a separate background matrix or cementing material. The pebbles or fragments are distinct and clearly separate from the surrounding rock material, indicating a high presence of the described property of having small fragments glued into a separate background texture."
S_Rock Salt_03.jpg,8.72
S_Rock Salt_04.jpg,"Based on the image provided, this rock specimen appears to be a conglomerate or breccia, containing numerous small pebbles or fragments embedded within a finer-grained matrix or cementing material. The pebbles and fragments are visibly distinct from the surrounding matrix material. Given the clear presence of these separate, glued-in pebbles or fragments as described in the instructions, I would rate this rock specimen as 8.75 on the provided 1.00 to 9.00 scale."
S_Rock Salt_05.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 2.75 on the scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform, coarse-grained texture throughout, without clearly distinct small fragments or pebbles visibly glued into a separate background matrix. While there are some slight variations in color and shading, the overall texture seems to be an inherent part of the rock's composition rather than containing separate embedded components. Therefore, I have assigned a rating towards the lower end of the scale, indicating a lack of clearly discernible glued-in fragments or pebbles against a contrasting background."

S_Rock Salt_09.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 8.72 on the scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have numerous small fragments or pebbles embedded within a separate, coarser background texture. These small fragments are visibly distinct from the surrounding rock material, indicating that they were likely ""glued"" or incorporated into the main rock body during its formation process. The presence of these clearly discernible embedded fragments suggests a high rating on the specified scale."

S_Rock Salt_12.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the instructions given, I would rate this rock as 8.72. The rock appears to have numerous small fragments or pebbles of varying shades and textures embedded within a lighter background matrix. These fragments seem distinctly separate from the surrounding rock material, indicating that they were likely ""glued"" into the background texture during the rock's formation process. The presence of these clearly discernible embedded fragments warrants a high rating on the specified scale."
S_Sandstone_01.jpg,"Based on the image provided, this rock appears to have a layered, sedimentary texture without any clearly discernible small fragments or pebbles glued into a separate background matrix. The rock exhibits parallel banding or striations of varying shades of brown, but the texture seems relatively uniform and cohesive throughout. Therefore, I would rate this rock as 2.37 on the provided scale from 1.00 to 9.00, indicating a low presence of separate small fragments or pebbles embedded within the rock's background."

S_Sandstone_12.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the criteria described, I would rate this rock as 2.75. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform, coarse-grained texture throughout, without any clearly discernible small fragments or pebbles that seem distinctly glued into a separate background matrix. While there are some slight variations in shading and coloration, the overall texture appears integrated rather than containing separate embedded components. Therefore, I have assigned a rating towards the lower end of the scale, indicating a lack of distinct glued-in fragments or pebbles against a contrasting background."

S_Shale_04.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 1.75 on the scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to be a single, solid piece without any visible small fragments or pebbles glued into a separate background texture. It has a rough, coarse surface but maintains a consistent texture and composition throughout. There are no distinct, separate pebbles or fragments embedded within the rock's surface."

S_Shale_06.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 2.37 on the scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform texture and composition throughout, without any clearly discernible small fragments or pebbles that seem glued or embedded into a separate background matrix. The variations in color and shading appear to be part of the inherent sedimentary layering or mineral composition of the rock itself, rather than distinct separate inclusions. Therefore, this rock would fall on the lower end of the rating scale, indicating an absence of the specific property being evaluated."

S_Shale_08.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 2.37 on the scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform texture and color throughout, without any distinct small fragments or pebbles visibly glued into a separate background matrix. It has a coarse, granular surface but does not seem to exhibit the specific property of having separate small pebbles or fragments embedded into a contrasting background material. Therefore, I have assigned a rating towards the lower end of the scale, indicating the absence of the described feature."

S_Shale_12.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 2.37 on the scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform, coarse-grained texture throughout, without any distinct small fragments or pebbles visibly glued into a separate background matrix. It has a rough, eroded surface but does not seem to exhibit the specific property of containing separate, glued-in pebbles or fragments against a contrasting background texture. Therefore, a rating towards the lower end of the scale around 2.37 seems appropriate for this particular rock sample."
