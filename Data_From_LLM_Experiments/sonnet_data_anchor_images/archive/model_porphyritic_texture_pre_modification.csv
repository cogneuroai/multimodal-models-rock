The rock appears to have numerous distinct small fragments or pebbles embedded within a separate background matrix, which is characteristic of a high porphyritic texture. The light-colored rounded inclusions are clearly visible and distinct from the darker surrounding material, indicating they are separate fragments glued into the background texture."
S_Conglomerate_11.jpg,"Based on the instructions and examples provided, I would rate this rock as 8.72 on the porphyritic texture scale. The rock appears to have numerous distinct pebble-like fragments or clasts embedded within a separate background matrix, which is characteristic of a high porphyritic texture. The pebbles or clasts vary in color from light gray to reddish-brown and are clearly distinguishable from the darker matrix material surrounding them. This composition strongly suggests the rock contains small fragments ""glued"" into a separate background texture, fitting the description for a rating in the 8.00-9.00 range."
S_Conglomerate_12.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the instructions given, I would rate this rock as 5.23 on the porphyritic texture scale from 1.00 to 9.00.

S_Shale_06.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 2.37 on the porphyritic texture scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform, layered texture without distinct small fragments or pebbles visibly embedded into a separate background matrix. The banded, striped patterns seem to be an inherent part of the rock's composition rather than separate inclusions glued into a distinct background material. Therefore, this rock would be considered a low porphyritic texture example, warranting a rating close to the lower end of the provided scale."
S_Shale_07.jpg,"Based on the instructions and examples provided, I would rate this rock image as 2.37 on the porphyritic texture scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform, fine-grained texture without distinct separate fragments or pebbles visibly embedded into a contrasting matrix. Its surface shows some variations in shading and texture, but these seem to be part of the overall rock material rather than distinct glued-in components. Therefore, this rock would be considered a low porphyritic texture case, warranting a rating closer to the lower end of the scale near 1.00 to 2.00."
S_Shale_08.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 2.75 on the porphyritic texture scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform, fine-grained texture throughout without any clearly distinct pebbles or fragments embedded within a separate matrix. While there are some slight variations in shading and texture, the rock does not exhibit a pronounced porphyritic texture with large phenocrysts set in a contrasting groundmass. Therefore, my rating leans towards the lower end of the scale, indicating a minimal or negligible porphyritic texture."
S_Shale_09.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the instructions given, I would rate this rock as 8.23 on the porphyritic texture scale. The rock appears to have distinct small fragments or pebbles embedded within a separate background matrix, which is characteristic of a high porphyritic texture. The contrasting colors and textures between the fragments and the surrounding material make this porphyritic texture quite evident."
S_Shale_10.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 2.75 on the porphyritic texture scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a fairly uniform, coarse-grained texture throughout, without distinct separate fragments or pebbles visibly embedded into a contrasting matrix or background. It has a rough, granular surface but does not exhibit the glued-in pebble or fragment texture described for higher ratings on the scale. Therefore, I have assigned a relatively low rating of 2.75 to indicate a minimal porphyritic texture."
S_Shale_11.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 7.82 on the porphyritic texture scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have distinct small fragments or pebbles embedded within a coarser background matrix, indicating a relatively high degree of porphyritic texture. However, it does not seem to be an extreme case, hence my rating falls slightly below the highest values on the scale."
S_Shale_12.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 2.75 on the porphyritic texture scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform, coarse-grained texture throughout, without distinct separate fragments or pebbles visibly embedded into a contrasting matrix or background. It has a sandy, eroded appearance but does not clearly exhibit the glued-in pebble or fragment texture described for higher ratings on the scale."
