I_Obsidian_02.jpg,"Based on the provided instructions and examples, for the rock shown in the image, I would rate it as 2.75 on the red-green contrast scale. The rock appears to have a deep reddish-purple hue with some lighter reddish-brown streaks, indicating it leans more towards the red end of the spectrum than the green end. However, it is not an intense, pure red, so I have given it a rating slightly above the mid-range to reflect its reddish coloration while allowing room for even redder rocks to receive lower scores closer to 1.00."

I_Obsidian_10.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 5.23 on the red-green contrast scale. The rock appears to have a predominantly neutral gray/black color with some lighter gray and white streaks or veins running through it. There are no strong red or green hues evident, so I have given it a rating close to the neutral midpoint of 5.00, but slightly higher to account for the lighter gray tones that could be interpreted as having a very faint greenish tint."

The rock appears to have a predominantly neutral gray/white coloration with some darker gray and pinkish hues mixed in. While there are hints of reddish tones, the overall color leans more towards the neutral/gray side of the spectrum rather than a strong red or green hue. Therefore, a rating slightly above the midpoint of 5.00 seems appropriate to reflect the rock's muted, neutral coloring with a slight tendency towards reddish tones."
