I_Andesite_01.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 4.75 on the pegmatitic structure scale from 1.00 to 9.00. While the rock does not display large, distinct shiny bands or crystals embedded in a separate background matrix, it does exhibit a somewhat coarse, crystalline texture with lighter mineral grains dispersed throughout the darker matrix. This suggests a hint of the pegmatitic property, though not to a strong or pronounced degree. Therefore, a rating around the middle range of 4.75 seems appropriate to capture the slight pegmatitic characteristics present in this particular rock sample."
I_Andesite_02.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 5.32 on the pegmatitic structure scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to exhibit some larger crystal formations embedded within a finer-grained matrix, suggesting a moderate degree of pegmatitic texture. However, the large crystals or bands are not as prominently displayed as in the high pegmatitic structure example provided. Therefore, a rating around the middle range of 5.32 seems appropriate to reflect the partial presence of this characteristic in the given rock sample."

S_Sandstone_12.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 2.75 on the pegmatitic structure scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform, fine-grained texture without any distinct large crystals or shiny bands that would indicate a strong pegmatitic structure. However, there are some subtle variations in color and texture that suggest a very minor hint of pegmatitic features, hence a rating slightly above the lowest end of the scale."
S_Shale_01.jpg,"Based on the image provided, this rock does not appear to exhibit any large, shiny bands or crystals embedded in a separate background matrix. The rock seems to have a relatively uniform, dark brown color and texture throughout. Therefore, I would rate this rock as 1.25 on the provided scale from 1.00 to 9.00, indicating a very low or negligible expression of the described pegmatitic structure property."
S_Shale_02.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 4.32 on the pegmatitic structure scale from 1.00 to 9.00. While there are no large, distinct shiny bands or crystals clearly visible, the rock appears to have some textural variations and banding that could hint at a mild pegmatitic structure. However, this structure is not strongly pronounced, hence the moderate rating around the middle of the scale."
S_Shale_03.jpg,"Based on the image provided, this rock does not appear to exhibit any large, shiny bands or crystals embedded in a separate background matrix, which would indicate a pegmatitic structure. The rock seems to have a relatively uniform reddish-brown color and texture throughout. Therefore, my rating for the extent to which this rock displays a pegmatitic structure would be 1.23 on the scale from 1.00 to 9.00."
S_Shale_04.jpg,"Based on the image provided, this rock does not appear to exhibit any large, shiny bands or crystals embedded in a separate background matrix. The rock seems to be a relatively uniform, dark gray color with a rough, textured surface. Given the instructions to rate rocks with no pegmatitic structure between 1.00 and 2.00, I would rate this particular rock as 1.25 on the provided scale from 1.00 to 9.00."
S_Shale_05.jpg,"Based on the image provided, this rock does not appear to exhibit any large, shiny bands or crystals embedded in a separate background matrix. The rock seems to have a relatively uniform, dark brown color and texture throughout. Therefore, I would rate this rock as 1.25 on the provided scale from 1.00 to 9.00, indicating a very low or negligible expression of the described pegmatitic structure property."
S_Shale_06.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 8.75 on the pegmatitic structure scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock displays very prominent large, shiny bands or crystals embedded in a separate background matrix, which is a strong indication of a pegmatitic texture. The banded structure with distinct large crystals is clearly visible across most of the rock surface shown in the image."
S_Shale_07.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 1.32 on the pegmatitic structure scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a fairly uniform, fine-grained texture without any large, distinct crystals or shiny bands visible. It lacks the characteristic features of a pegmatitic structure, where large crystals are embedded in a separate background matrix. Therefore, this rock sample exhibits a very low degree of the described pegmatitic property."
S_Shale_08.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 2.75 on the pegmatitic structure scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform, fine-grained texture without any large, distinct crystals or shiny bands that would indicate a strong pegmatitic structure. However, there are some subtle variations in color and texture that suggest a slightly elevated rating above the lowest end of the scale."
S_Shale_09.jpg,"Based on the image provided and the criteria outlined, I would rate this rock as 5.25 on the pegmatitic structure scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock displays some hints of larger crystal formations embedded within a separate background matrix, though the pegmatitic texture is not extremely pronounced or dominant throughout the sample. There appear to be bands or veins of a lighter colored mineral cutting through the darker host rock, suggesting the presence of pegmatitic segregations, albeit in a moderately expressed manner."
S_Shale_10.jpg,"Based on the image provided, this rock does not appear to exhibit any large, shiny bands or crystals embedded in a separate background matrix. The rock seems to have a relatively uniform, dark gray color and rough texture throughout. Given the instructions to rate rocks with no pegmatitic structure between 1.00 and 2.00, I would rate this particular rock as 1.25 on the provided scale from 1.00 to 9.00."
S_Shale_11.jpg,"Based on the instructions and examples provided, I would rate this rock as 7.85 for displaying a pegmatitic structure with large, shiny bands of crystals embedded in a separate background matrix. The rock exhibits prominent bands and veins of what appear to be large crystalline minerals contrasting against a reddish-brown host rock, indicating a strong expression of the described pegmatitic texture."
S_Shale_12.jpg,"Based on the image provided, I would rate this rock as 1.75 on the pegmatitic structure scale from 1.00 to 9.00. The rock appears to have a relatively uniform, fine-grained texture without any large, distinct crystals or shiny bands embedded in a separate background matrix. It lacks the characteristic features of a highly pegmatitic rock structure, displaying little to no evidence of that property."
