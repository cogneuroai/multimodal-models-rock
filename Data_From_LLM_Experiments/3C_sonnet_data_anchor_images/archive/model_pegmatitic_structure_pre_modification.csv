This matches the key characteristics described for rocks that strongly display the desired property. The shiny crystal bands are very prominent and distinct from the duller surrounding material, closely resembling the examples labeled as 8.00. However, the bands seem slightly more extensive than those examples, so I have rated it slightly higher at 8.75 to reflect the strong presence of the described property."
M_Gneiss_09.jpg,"Based on the description and examples provided, this rock displays the described property of having long and thick shiny crystal bands that are embedded in a separate dull background. The rock appears to have distinct layers or bands of shiny, dark crystals contrasted against a lighter, duller matrix.

M_Gneiss_10.jpg,"Based on the description and examples provided, I would rate this rock as 4.25 on the specified scale from 1.00 to 9.00. While the rock does not display long, thick, shiny crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background to a strong degree, it does exhibit some hints of that property with the darker mineral veins or bands running through the lighter pinkish-tan matrix. However, the veins do not appear distinctly shiny or thick enough to warrant a higher rating in the upper half of the scale."
M_Gneiss_11.jpg,"Based on the description and examples provided, I would rate this rock as 8.25. The rock appears to have long, thick, shiny black crystal bands embedded in a separate dull background matrix, which strongly displays the described property of interest.
